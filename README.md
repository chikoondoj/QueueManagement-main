 Here are the changes made to the CSS to enhance the professional and aesthetic appearance of the navbar:

Navbar Background Color:

Changed the background color to #192839 (a dark blue) to give a more professional look.
Logo Container:

Set the width to auto to dynamically adjust based on the content.
Ensured the elements are evenly spaced and aligned centrally.
Logo Text:

Changed the color to #FFFFFF (white) for high contrast against the dark background.
Slightly reduced the font size to 1.6em for better proportion and balance.
Maintained a font weight of 600 for emphasis and a professional appearance.
Applied text-transform: uppercase to make the text uppercase for a more formal look.
Added letter-spacing: 0.05em for improved readability.
Ensured no default margin is applied by setting margin: 0.
Navigation Menu:

Set the width to auto to dynamically adjust based on the content.
Aligned items centrally vertically for a uniform appearance.
Used justify-content: space-between to spread menu items evenly within the available space.
Logo Changes:

Trace the path of the logo in the Build/Static files and the src/components/Assets to locate the PNG and the SVG Logo picture and name.
Search for a substitute picture and paste in the exact folders and renaming in the same as the previous logo in order to subtitute the logo design.
That allows to simpply reload the code and the new logo will be demonstrated.
The only step is specifying the right file type as PNG for one and SVG for the other.
